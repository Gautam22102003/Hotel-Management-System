# Hotel-Management-System
A **Hotel Management System (HMS)** in Java is a comprehensive software solution designed to automate and streamline the various operations within a hotel, providing a centralized platform for managing reservations, check-ins, check-outs, billing, and guest services. The system typically consists of multiple modules, such as:

1. **Room Management**:
   - Tracks room availability, room types (e.g., single, double, suite), and room status (e.g., available, booked, under maintenance).
   - Facilitates assigning rooms to guests based on their preferences and availability.
   - Handles the updating of room status as guests check in or out.

2. **Guest Management**:
   - Stores guest information such as name, contact details, booking history, and payment records.
   - Manages guest check-in and check-out processes, ensuring smooth transitions.
   - Allows staff to search for guest records and update guest details during their stay.

3. **Booking System**:
   - Enables customers or hotel staff to make, modify, or cancel reservations.
   - Handles room availability checks, date selection, and reservation confirmation.
   - Integrates with the payment system to allow advance deposits or full payments at the time of booking.

4. **Reports and Analytics**:
   - Generates various reports, including occupancy rates, revenue reports, and financial summaries.
   - Provides insights into room utilization, booking trends, and guest preferences to help improve business operations.

5. **Exception Handling**:
    - Handles errors and exceptional situations such as unavailable rooms, payment issues, or database connection failures, providing meaningful messages to users.

The **Hotel Management System** improves efficiency by reducing manual work, minimizing errors, and speeding up daily operations. It can be deployed on local servers or integrated into cloud-based solutions to provide real-time access and multi-location support. Additionally, the system can be extended with features like mobile app integration, multi-language support, and more advanced reporting features.
